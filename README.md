A Game Theory project from 2014

The rules:
<li>Two players take turns writing digits from 1 to 5 in one line,
until they get a 2N-digit number (the length of the number is known in advance).</li>
<li>If the resulting number is divisible by 9, the second player wins.</li>
<li>If the resulting number is not divisible by 9, the first player wins.</li>
